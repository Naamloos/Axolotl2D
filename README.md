Axolotl2D is a small lightweight 2D game engine based on [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET). It was build as a personal practice project, intended for smaller indie games. It makes heavy use of Microsoft's hosting extensions and thus supports and makes heavy use of dependency injection.
